# Text Summarization App

## By: Jan Galinski, Thomas Elbert, Kamil Kinastowski, Kuba Bia≈Çczyk

This app takes user input (plain text or URL) and summarizes it. Summary is based on the output of sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-6-6 model accessed via HuggingFace transformers library. The user can write a title of the text that will be uploaded. Then the text or URL can be pasted. In case of using URL app will scrape the text present under given URL. The summarization is not applicable for really short inputs and if the input is too short the user will be informed. After that the model will summarize given text and present the output. Then user can copy the text or save it. Summaries are saved locally in "saved_summaries" folder. In the "Files" section the saved texts will be presented. User also can read the "About us" page.

The needed libraries for this project are: kivy, pyperclip, newspaper3k and transformers. 

To run the app you need to enter the landing_py.py and run it in the terminal.

To run it, either download this model: https://huggingface.co/sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-6-6? or change the value of variable model_name in the landing_page.py file to "sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-6-6".

The second option will download the model every time you run the app, so it will be heavy for your internet. I recommend downloading the model -- it is also available in google drive (you need to download the whole folder and keep it in that form in the same directory as landing_page.py file): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-tdiEXw6Vrv1PucZ0BXGxdgr6mMaAhwe?usp=sharing
